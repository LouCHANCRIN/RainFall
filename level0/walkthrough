We have a binary file. #readelf

There is a binary file when logging in.
When it is launched with no arguments it return a segfault, else it print "No !"

We get the assembly code with
$ gdb ./level0
(gdb) disassemble main

We can see that the first function call is atoi and it is followed by a comparison between 423 and a register (cmp $0x1a7,%eax).
Therefore we try to launch the binary with 423 as argument.
It opens a new shell.
We try the command 'ls' but we get a permission denied.
We try pwd and see we are in '/home/user/level0' and 'whoami' gives us 'level1' so we can assume there is a '/home/user/level1' directory.
We then go to that directory and type 'ls -la' and we can see a file named '.pass' that contain the flag.

$ ./level0 423
$ cat /home/user/level1/.pass
